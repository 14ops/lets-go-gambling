## Mathematical Foundations

### Probability Theory

#### Hypergeometric Distribution

The foundation of our mine avoidance strategy relies on the hypergeometric distribution, which models the probability of success in sampling without replacement:

```
P(X = k) = C(K,k) × C(N-K,n-k) / C(N,n)
```

Where:
- N = total number of cells
- K = number of mines
- n = number of cells revealed
- k = number of mines encountered

#### Expected Value Calculation

The expected value of continuing versus cashing out is calculated as:

```
EV(continue) = P(safe) × E[next_multiplier] - P(mine) × current_value
EV(cashout) = current_multiplier
```

Optimal decision: Continue if EV(continue) > EV(cashout)

#### Kelly Criterion

For optimal bet sizing, we employ the Kelly Criterion:

```
f* = (bp - q) / b
```

Where:
- f* = optimal fraction of bankroll to bet
- b = odds received on the wager
- p = probability of winning
- q = probability of losing (1-p)

### Statistical Analysis

#### Sharpe Ratio

Risk-adjusted return measurement:

```
Sharpe Ratio = (E[R] - Rf) / σ(R)
```

Where:
- E[R] = expected return
- Rf = risk-free rate
- σ(R) = standard deviation of returns

#### Value at Risk (VaR)

Risk measurement at confidence level α:

```
VaR_α = -F^(-1)(α)
```

Where F^(-1) is the inverse cumulative distribution function of returns.

### Game Theory Applications

#### Nash Equilibrium

In multi-strategy scenarios, we seek Nash equilibrium where no strategy can unilaterally improve performance:

```
π_i(s_i*, s_{-i}*) ≥ π_i(s_i, s_{-i}*) ∀ s_i ∈ S_i
```

#### Minimax Strategy

For worst-case scenario planning:

```
max_i min_j u_i(s_i, s_j)
```

### Machine Learning Mathematics

#### Q-Learning Update Rule

```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max_a' Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
```

Where:
- α = learning rate
- γ = discount factor
- r = immediate reward

#### Bayesian Inference

Posterior probability calculation:

```
P(H|E) = P(E|H) × P(H) / P(E)
```

Applied to safe cell prediction based on observed patterns.
